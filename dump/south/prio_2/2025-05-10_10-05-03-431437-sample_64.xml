**A note:** 

This example uses a variety of features including import, a function, alternate link, image, and an attribute based link (xlink:href). 
This example demonstrates use of XSLT which is included in the XML document. 

**Note-2:** The document has multiple namespace included for testing parsing capabilities. 

**Note-3:** The document has multiple characters set used throughout which may be subject to encoding parsing tests. 

**Note-4:** The document does not have any root or child element based name conflicts, so an empty document was not created for the root child element. 

Note: This output is a short but complex XML document. It has structural richness and novelty which makes it a suitable fuzz-test. The XML document uses a variety of XML features, which makes it challenging for the parser
