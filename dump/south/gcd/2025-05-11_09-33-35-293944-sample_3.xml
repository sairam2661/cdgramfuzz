          &note; would expand to "Note", but since we use &apos;&amp;, 
          it first expands to "&apos;&amp;Note", and since &apos; is a quote char,
          that string contains an unescaped quote, so the parser will think that 
          it is closing the paragraph which is incorrect. Therefore, it's a test case
