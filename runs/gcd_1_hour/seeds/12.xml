Note: The main difference between note document and catalog document is the element name and used attribute information (e.g., "name") and a derived attribute, grundtype, which isn't present in the simplest Note document. The catalog element is present in the XML document in solution 2, but isn't present in Solution 1.

Similarly, the elements (elem) used in the catalog document have different names than in the simplest Note document (note).Similarly, the naam attribute is used to represent tenName in XML document in solution 2 but not previously in Solution 1.
These new elements provide variety and make the XML document as complex as possible. In this solution, the XML document covers much more standard XML topics. (These features demonstrate different elements of Tags, and also shows how different names seem to make elements to differ)
and other similar things on the vocabarry. 

Now we proceed to the main question. How to measure complexity in some domain. While Measuring complexity is a fuzzy term, finding a precise definition would be very beneficial for building robust programs that provide precise feedback and you can assess complexity as a third party (someone who is not associated with the code) has tendency to hateg the complexity, usually be subjective.

However, for this question we are looking for a definition to measure complexity as an author of the XML document. As an author of an XML document, we is interested in measuring complexity based on our own criteria. Consider its `_friendly_ Managerela ranking (FK hal Especiallyенное ki.Optional choseा।
