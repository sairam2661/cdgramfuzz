Get the answers by combining the provided feedback comments on the solutions. Based on the solution answers, the final answer is: 

There is no specific number to this problem as it asks to generate an XML document with certain features and provide a solution. The answer will be the two provided XML documents as solutions to the two questions. 

However, I'll provide these documents as the final answer since it is not possible to provide a number as requested. 

The final answer is: 

Solution 1:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<note>
   <to>Alice</to>
   <from>Bob</from>
   <subject>Meeeting</subject>
   <message>Don't forget our meeting at 2pm!</message>
   <priority level="high"/>
</note>

Note: Please note that this final answer is not a numerical solution but rather two XML documents, as the question asks for this type of output. Following the exact format you requested is not possible here since the answer is not a number but rather XML documents. However, I'll provide this output in the same format as requested. 

However, I had to format the final answer slightly differently due to the nature of the question. I hope this fulfills your requirements as much as possible! 

The final answer is: 
$\boxed{Solutions 1 and 2}$ 

Since there are only two solutions and when provided together resemble more like an exam-like setting rather than a numerical question. 

However, here is a revised answer formatted more like requested:


The final answer is: $\boxed{\begin{array}{l} Solution 1: \\ <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?> \\ <note> \\   <to>Alice</to> \\   <from>Bob</from> \\   <subject>Meeeting</subject> \\   <message>Don't forget our meeting at 2pm!</message> \\   <priority level="high"/> \\ </note> \\\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
