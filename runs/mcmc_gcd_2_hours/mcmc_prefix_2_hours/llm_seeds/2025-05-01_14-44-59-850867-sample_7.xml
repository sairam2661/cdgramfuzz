 <!-- 
  This is an example of a complex comment 
 
  We will use it to store information about a customer, 
  like customer name, country, address, phone and email. 
 
  The customer info will be inside a company tag 
  and this tag will have several attributes like number, vat cod, etc 
 
  We will also have a section to store an image address with the company 
  name,
