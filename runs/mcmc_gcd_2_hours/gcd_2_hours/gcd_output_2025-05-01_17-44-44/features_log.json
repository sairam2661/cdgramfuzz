I'll also provide examples to illustrate each feature. \n\nHere is a sample XML document to illustrate some of these features:\n```\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE book [\n  <!ELEMENT book (title, author, publisher)>\n  <!ELEMENT title (#PCDATA)>\n  <!ELEMENT author (#PCDATA)>\n  <!ELEMENT publisher (#PCDATA)>\n\n  <!ATTLIST book attribut1=\"value1\" attribut2=\"value2\">\n  <!ATTLIST publisher attribut3=\"value3\" attribut4=\"value4\">\n\n  <!ENTITY public_entity \"Public Entity\">\n  <!ENTITY entityref \"&public_entity;\">\n\n  <!NOTATION public_notation \"http://example.com/public_notation\">\n  <book>\n    <title>Example Title</title>\n    <author>John Doe</author>\n    <publisher>\n      <attribut3 value3=\"value3\"/>\n      <attribut4 value4=\"value4\"/>\n    </publisher>\n  </book>\n</xml>\n```\nPlease note that the XML declaration is included in the document to provide a clear example of the features. \n\nPlease provide the final list of distinct technical features. \n\nI'll ensure that each feature has a corresponding example. \n\nHere is the list so far:"
